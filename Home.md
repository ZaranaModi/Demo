This Wiki complements the [Spring Framework reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/) and is used to explain concepts (vs provide a reference), to maintain documents we want to edit independent of release cadence, or to summarize information across multiple versions. 

If you're new to Spring, read the [Spring Framework Overview](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#spring-introduction) in the reference for a quick introduction to origins, design philosophy, and the family of Spring projects. Use the menu on the left to navigate the Wiki content. 

If you'd like to contribute please review the guidelines described in the project-level [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

For an opinionated jump-start, check out the [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project, use [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to create an application, or follow a [guide or tutorial](https://spring.io/guides).
