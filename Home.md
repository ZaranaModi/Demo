This wiki complements the [Spring Framework reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/). We use it to explain concepts (vs provide a reference), to maintain documents we want to edit independent of release cadence, or to summarize information across multiple versions.

If you're new to Spring, see the [Overview](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#spring-introduction) in the reference, for a quick introduction to the Spring Framework, its origins, history, design philosophy, and family of [Spring projects](https://spring.io/projects). 

For an opinionated jump-start, check out [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project, use [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to create an application, or follow [guide or tutorial](https://spring.io/guides).
