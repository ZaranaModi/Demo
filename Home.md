This Wiki complements the [Spring Framework reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/). We use it to explain concepts (vs providing a reference), to maintain documents we want to edit independent of release cadence, or to summarize information across multiple versions. 

If you're new, please read the [Spring Framework Overview](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#spring-introduction).

If you'd like to contribute, review the guidelines in the project-level [CONTRIBUTING.adoc](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc).

For an opinionated jump-start, check out the [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project, use [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to create an application, or follow one of the available [guides and tutorials](https://spring.io/guides).
