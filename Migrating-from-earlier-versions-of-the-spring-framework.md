This page discusses what what users will want to know when upgrading from earlier version of this Spring Framework. Previously, migration guides were included as an Appendix to the reference documentation. Starting with Spring Framework 4.0, we will be exclusively using this WIKI page for upgrade information.

If you find any issues that are not covered by this guide please raise a [JIRA](http://jira.springsource.org) or submit a pull-request against this page.
