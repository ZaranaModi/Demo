# What's New in Spring Framework 5.x

## New Features and Enhancements in Spring Framework 5.0

### Java 8 Baseline

### Removed Deprecated Packages and Methods

### Core Container Improvements

### Reactive Programming Model

### Web Improvements

### Testing Improvements

* Complete support for [JUnit 5](http://junit.org/junit5/)'s _Jupiter_ programming and 
  extension models in the Spring TestContext Framework.
  * `SpringExtension`: an implementation of multiple extension APIs from JUnit Jupiter 
    that provides full support for the existing feature set of the Spring TestContext 
    Framework. This support is enabled via `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)`.
  * `@SpringJUnitConfig`: a composed annotation that combines 
    `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)` from JUnit Jupiter with `@ContextConfiguration` 
    from the Spring TestContext Framework.
  * `@SpringJUnitWebConfig`: a composed annotation that combines 
    `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)` from JUnit Jupiter with `@ContextConfiguration` 
	and `@WebAppConfiguration` from the Spring TestContext Framework.
* New _before_ and _after_ test execution callbacks in the Spring TestContext Framework
  with support for TestNG, JUnit 5, and JUnit 4 via the `SpringRunner` (but not via JUnit
  4 rules).
  * New `beforeTestExecution()` and `afterTestExecution()` callbacks in the
    `TestExecutionListener` API and `TestContextManager`.
