# Supported Versions

4.3.x and 5.0 are the actively supported branches in the 4th and 5th generation respectively. Limited support for 3.2.x is still available but no further maintenance releases are planned in that line. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest Spring Framework 5.0.x or 4.3.x release listed on [spring.io/spring-framework](http://spring.io/spring-framework).
