# Supported Versions

- 5.1.x is the latest and recommended line
- 5.0.x has been superseded by 5.1.x, but is supported for Boot 2.0's lifetime still (~ March 2019)
- 4.3.x is the last branch of the 4th generation, it's got an extended support life until 2020 so you can migrate your applications to the latest generation safely
- 3.2.x is EOL, no further maintenance releases are planned in that line

We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest Spring Framework 5.1.x or 4.3.x release listed on [spring.io/spring-framework](http://spring.io/spring-framework).
